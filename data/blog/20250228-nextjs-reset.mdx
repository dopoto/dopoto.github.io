title: A better way to recover from Next.js errors

As per <a target="_blank" href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/error-handling#nested-error-boundaries">Next.js docs</a>, you can attempt
to recover from an error by using the provided `reset` callback in an `error.tsx` file:

```tsx:error.tsx
'use client'

export default function Error({
  error,
  reset,
}: {
  error: Error & { digest?: string }
  reset: () => void
}) {
  ...
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>
      <button
        onClick={
          // Attempt to recover by trying to re-render the segment
          () => reset()
        }
      >
        Try again
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

However, that seems to never work. For example, with the `page.tsx` below, you would expect `reset` to always trigger a new
exception. Yet it doesn't - the server-side code does not re-execute when you click the `Try again` button.

```tsx:page.tsx
export default async function Page() {
  throw new Error(Date.now().toString())
}
```

## Solution

To make this actually attempt a proper route segment refresh, wrap the `reset` function, together with a `router.refresh()`, in a `startTransition`:

```tsx:error.tsx
'use client'

import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

export default function Error({
  error,
  reset,
}: {
  error: Error & { digest?: string }
  reset: () => void
}) {
  ...
  const router = useRouter();

  function refresh() {
      startTransition(() => {
          router.refresh();
          reset();
      });
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>
      <button
        onClick={refresh}
      >
        Try again
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Why does this work?

Okay, let's break down why the combination of `router.refresh()`, `reset()` and `startTransition` works to effectively "reset the route" after an error, while `reset()` alone often doesn't.

### What reset() does

The `reset()` function provided to the `error.tsx` component is specific to the `Error Boundary` mechanism.
Its primary job is to tell Next.js: "Okay, I acknowledge the error happened, please try to re-render the component tree within this specific error boundary's scope".
It does not inherently re-fetch data or re-run server-side logic for the route. It primarily attempts a client-side re-render of the segment that threw the error.

Why it often fails alone: If the error was caused by something persistent (like bad data fetched during the initial server render, a corrupted server state related to that route,
or a transient server issue that resolved but left the client with bad data), simply re-rendering the client components won't fix the underlying problem.
The components will likely try to render with the same faulty data or state that caused the initial error.

### What router.refresh() does

It triggers a server-side refresh of the current route.
This means Next.js will:

- Re-request the current route from the server.
- Re-run data fetching logic (Server Components, Route Handlers, etc.) for that route on the server.
- Re-render the Server Components for that route on the server.
- Send the updated payload (the fresh data and rendered Server Components) back to the client.

The client intelligently merges this update without losing unrelated client-side state (like `useState` in components outside the refreshed segment) or browser state (like scroll position).

### What startTransition() does

`startTransition` is a React hook. It marks state updates inside its callback as "transitions". This tells React that the update might cause
visual changes that shouldn't block the browser's main thread (preventing the UI from freezing).
React can then prioritize rendering, potentially show pending UI states (`isPending` becomes true), and ensure a smoother user experience
during potentially slow operations like data fetching and re-rendering triggered by `router.refresh()`.

### Why the combination of startTransition, router.refresh and reset works

`startTransition`<br/>
You wrap the recovery logic in startTransition because refreshing the route involves network requests and potentially significant re-rendering, which
can be slow. This prevents the UI from locking up when the user clicks "Try again".

`router.refresh()`<br/>
This is the core step to fix the root cause if the error stemmed from server-side issues or stale/bad data. It goes back to
the server to get a fresh, potentially corrected version of the route's data and server components.

`reset()`<br/>
After `router.refresh()` has hopefully fetched fresh data and fixed the underlying server-side state, `reset()` tells the specific error
boundary: "Now, attempt the re-render of your segment again".
With the fresh data/state potentially available thanks to `router.refresh()`, this re-render attempt has a much higher chance of succeeding.

### Summary

`reset()` alone only tries to re-render the client-side components within the boundary, often failing if the error's cause is server-side or data-related.
`router.refresh()` forces a server-side refresh, fetching new data and re-running server logic, addressing potential root causes.

`reset()` is still needed after `router.refresh()` to explicitly tell the error boundary mechanism to retry rendering its specific segment.

`startTransition` wraps the process to ensure a non-blocking, smoother user experience during the refresh and re-render attempt.
Therefore, the combination `startTransition(() => { router.refresh(); reset(); });` provides a much more robust error recovery mechanism by
addressing both the potential server-side root cause (`router.refresh`) and triggering the client-side re-render attempt (`reset`) in a
non-blocking way (`startTransition`).
