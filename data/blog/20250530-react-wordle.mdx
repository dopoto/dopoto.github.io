Just watched this live coding exercise video on implementing Wordle in React in 1 hour.

As they were wrapping up their solution (around 39 minutes in), they noticed a new case that needed to be handled: multiple matches
of the same letter. For example, when the solution is `ABCAD` and your guess is `AXAXA` - what color is the game supposed to assign to each
of the three A's in the guess?

In the official game, you'll get something like this:

<div className="flex flex-row gap-1 text-[24px] font-bold">
  <div className="flex h-[45px] w-[35px] justify-center border-1 text-center text-green-700">A</div>
  <div className="flex h-[45px] w-[35px] justify-center border-1 text-center">X</div>
  <div className="flex h-[45px] w-[35px] justify-center border-1 text-center text-amber-600">A</div>
  <div className="flex h-[45px] w-[35px] justify-center border-1 text-center">X</div>
  <div className="flex h-[45px] w-[35px] justify-center border-1 text-center">A</div>
</div>

- The first A in your guess is in the same position as the first A in the solution => green
- The second A in your guess can still be found in the remaining letters of the solution => orange
- The third A in your guess has no match in the solution now => black

They assumed incorrectly that you would only get either green or orange in this case and they moved on. But that got me thinking - what if you get one of these
`But wait... what about this case?` questions as you're wrapping up your implementation - be it in a live interview or in your day-to-day? How ready is your
code to adapt and handle the new case?

So that got me thinking - how to implement the game rules in this scenario in a way that is easy to understand, to debug, to change and to unit test? 2.5 hours later,
here's my attempt - yet another React Wordle implementation:

<DemoLink url="https://nextjs-playground-two-sigma.vercel.app/wordle" />
<GitHubRepoLink url="https://github.com/dopoto/nextjs-playground/blob/master/src/app/wordle/page.tsx" />

OK, so let me now try to break down my approach:

The grid we need to render consists of three sections:

- your accepted guesses - these are words that have already been accepted / checked against the solution and go in the top rows.
- your current guess - always a single row, partial or full word, 1 to 5 letters, not accepted yet / not checked against the solution yet.
- your remaining attempts - these are just blank rows

Therefore, when rendering the grid, your accepted guesses and your current guess should be taken from the internal
component state, where ideally they have already been stored in an easy-to-use format (for example, accepted guesses
should already be compared against solution, colors should already be assigned to each their letters etc).

To tackle this, I first defined a type that would store the state of each letter in the accepted guesses:

```ts
type LetterResult = {
  letter: string
  color: 'green' | 'orange' | 'white'
}
```

Then, I added the state needed to hold accepted guesses and current guess:

```ts
const [acceptedGuesses, setAcceptedGuesses] = useState<Array<LetterResult[]>>([])
const [currentGuess, setCurrentGuess] = useState<string>('')
```

Now, we need to build the game rules parser - this kicks in whenever the player submits a new word.
We'll create a `calculateColors` function and place it outside of the component.
After we determine that a word is valid, we'll call this function to build our next accepted guess from it,
before we store it in the internal state of the component.

This is the core part of the game, and we want to be able to easily
test it manually and through unit tests without having to spin up the whole game:

```ts
/**
 * Calculates the color to apply to each letter of a guess.
 * 
 * NOTE: Once a letter has been matched (green), we still need
 * to match other occurences of that letter against the solution:
 * 
 * Frequency Counting
 * We first create a frequency map of solution letters that aren't exact positional matches.
 * 
 * Green Pass
 * Identify exact matches (green tiles) and mark these positions as processed.
 * 
 * Yellow Pass
 * For remaining letters, check against the solution's frequency count. Only mark yellow if 
 * letters remain in the count.
 * 
 * @param solution "ABCAD"
 * @param guess "AXAXA"
 * @returns 
 *[
    {
        "letter": "A", // <- first A, matches solution.
        "color": "green"
    },
    {
        "letter": "X",
        "color": "white"
    },
    {
        "letter": "A", // <- second A, still found in remaining letters of solution.
        "color": "orange"
    },
    {
        "letter": "X",
        "color": "white"
    },
    {
        "letter": "A", // <- third A, no longer found in remaining letters of solution.
        "color": "white"
    }
]
 */
function calculateColors(solution: string, guess: string): LetterResult[] {
  const solutionLetters = [...solution]
  const guessLetters = [...guess]
  const result: LetterResult[] = Array(guess.length)
    .fill(null)
    .map(() => ({ letter: '', color: 'white' }))
  const letterCounts: { [key: string]: number } = {}

  // First pass: count letters in solution (excluding exact matches)
  for (let i = 0; i < solutionLetters.length; i++) {
    if (solutionLetters[i] !== guessLetters[i]) {
      letterCounts[solutionLetters[i]] = (letterCounts[solutionLetters[i]] || 0) + 1
    }
  }

  // Second pass: check for exact matches (greens)
  for (let i = 0; i < guessLetters.length; i++) {
    result[i].letter = guessLetters[i]

    if (solutionLetters[i] === guessLetters[i]) {
      result[i].color = 'green'
      guessLetters[i] = '' // Mark as processed
    }
  }

  // Third pass: check for yellows (existing letters in wrong position)
  for (let i = 0; i < guessLetters.length; i++) {
    if (guessLetters[i] === '') continue

    if (letterCounts[guessLetters[i]] > 0) {
      result[i].color = 'orange'
      letterCounts[guessLetters[i]]--
    }
  }

  return result
}
```

Before rendering the grid, we'll first need to do some hacking to force-show a keyboard on mobile devices, since we don't have any actual
input fields on the screen that would trigger it:

```ts
  return (
    <div className="container">
      {/* Focusable input for mobile keyboard */}
      <div style={{ position: "relative" }}>
        <input
          ref={mobileKeyboardInputRef}
          type="text"
          inputMode="text"
          autoFocus
          value={currentGuess}
          onChange={handleInputChange}
          onKeyDown={handleInputKeyDown}
          maxLength={WORD_LENGTH}
          style={{
            position: "absolute",
            top: 0,
            left: 0,
            width: 1,
            height: 1,
            opacity: 0.01,
            zIndex: 1,
          }}
          aria-label="Wordle input"
        />
        {/* Overlay to focus input on tap (for mobile reliability) - only covers the grid */}
        <div
          style={{
            position: "absolute",
            top: 0,
            left: 0,
            width: "100%",
            height: "100%",
            zIndex: 0,
          }}
          onClick={() => mobileKeyboardInputRef.current?.focus()}
          aria-hidden="true"
        />
        <div className="grid">
        TODO
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
```

We can now start taking user input (pressed keys):

```ts
function submitGuess(guess: WordleWord) {
  const isValidWord = UPPERCASE_WORDS.includes(guess.toUpperCase())
  if (!isValidWord) {
    setIsShaking(true)
    setTimeout(() => {
      setIsShaking(false)
    }, 500)
    return
  }

  const processedGuess = calculateColors(solution, guess)
  setAcceptedGuesses([...acceptedGuesses, processedGuess])
  setCurrentGuess('')

  if (guess === solution) {
    setGameResult('won')
    return
  }

  if (acceptedGuesses.length === ATTEMPTS - 1) {
    setGameResult('lost')
    return
  }
}

function handleInputChange(e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
  let value = e.target.value.toUpperCase()
  // Only allow letters, max length
  value = value.replace(/[^A-Z]/g, '').slice(0, WORD_LENGTH)
  setCurrentGuess(value)
}

function handleInputKeyDown(e: React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
  if (e.key === 'Enter' && currentGuess.length === WORD_LENGTH) {
    submitGuess(currentGuess)
    e.preventDefault()
  } else if ((e.key === 'Backspace' || e.key === 'Delete') && currentGuess) {
    setCurrentGuess((prev) => prev.slice(0, -1))
    e.preventDefault()
  }
}
```

Build the rows:

```ts
const rows: Record<number, { type: 'accepted' | 'current' | 'blank' }> = {}
new Array(ATTEMPTS).fill('').forEach((_, idx) => {
  if (acceptedGuesses[idx]) {
    rows[idx] = { type: 'accepted' }
  } else if (idx === acceptedGuesses.length) {
    rows[idx] = { type: 'current' }
  } else {
    rows[idx] = { type: 'blank' }
  }
})
```

All we need to do now is render the actual grid:

```ts
<div className="grid">
  {Object.entries(rows).map(([key, value]) => {
    const shakeClass =
      isShaking && key === acceptedGuesses.length.toString()
        ? "shake"
        : "";
    return (
      <div key={key} className={`row ${shakeClass}`}>
        {value.type === "accepted" &&
          new Array(WORD_LENGTH).fill("").map((_, idx) => {
            const { color, letter } =
              acceptedGuesses[key as unknown as number][idx];
            return (
              <div key={`a${key}${idx}`} className={`cell ${color}`}>
                {letter}
              </div>
            );
          })}
        {value.type === "current" &&
          new Array(WORD_LENGTH).fill("").map((_, idx) => {
            const letter = currentGuess.split("")[idx];
            return (
              <div key={`c${key}${idx}`} className="cell grayletter">
                {letter}
              </div>
            );
          })}
        {value.type === "blank" &&
          new Array(WORD_LENGTH).fill("").map((_, idx) => {
            return <div key={`b${key}${idx}`} className="cell"></div>;
          })}
      </div>
    );
  })}
</div>
```
