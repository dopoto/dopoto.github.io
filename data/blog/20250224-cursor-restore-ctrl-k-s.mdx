title: Restoring Save All with Ctrl + K,S in Cursor

`Ctrl + K,S` (Save All) is something I do by reflex every 20 seconds or so in VS Code. But Cursor decided to break this nice flow by hijacking `Ctrl + K`.

So here's a quick way to fix that and make `Ctrl + K,S` save all in Cursor too:

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the Cursor command palette.
- Search for `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)` and select it. This will open your keybindings.json file, where you can define custom keybindings.
- In keybindings.json, add the following entry to override the hijacked shortcut:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+k s",
    "command": "workbench.action.files.saveAll",
    "when": "editorTextFocus"
  }
]
```
