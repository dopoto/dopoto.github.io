Published a small repo showing how to implement a dynamic breadcrumb navigator in a
Next.js / app router appplication.

Routes need to be defined hierarchically:

```ts:routes.ts
export const routes: ManagerRoute[] = [
  {
    name: "Manager",
    path: "/manager",
    childRoutes: [
      {
        name: "Locations",
        path: "/manager/locations",
        childRoutes: [{ name: "Add location", path: "/manager/locations/add" }],
      },
      {
        name: "Widgets",
        path: "/manager/widgets",
        childRoutes: [
          { name: "Add widget", path: "/manager/widgets/add" },
          {
            name: "Subwidgets",
            path: "/manager/widgets/subwidgets",
            childRoutes: [
              { name: "Add subwidget", path: "/manager/widgets/subwidgets/add" },
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

A breadcrumb navigation path is created out of the parents of the currently active route:

A list of links is also built for all the siblings in each segment of the breadcrumb:
