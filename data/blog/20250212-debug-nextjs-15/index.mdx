title: Debugging in Next.js 15 + Turbopack

summary: How to set up your launch.json config to debug server-side code with Next.js 15 / Turbopack
---

Took a bit of trial-and-error, but I managed to get server-side debugging to work in my VS Code, using this `.vscode/launch.json` configuration:

```js
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
      {
        "name": "Next.js: debug server-side",
        "type": "node",
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/next/dist/bin/next",
        "args": [
          "dev"
        ],
        "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
        "autoAttachChildProcesses": true,
        "skipFiles": [
          "<node_internals>/**"
        ],
        "serverReadyAction": {
          "pattern": "started server on .+? \\(http://.+?\\)",
          "uriFormat": "%s",
          "action": "openExternally"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```

My environment:

- VS Code on Windows 11 / Node v22.10.0
- Next.js 15.1.7, running `"next dev --turbopack"`
